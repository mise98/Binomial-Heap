# Binomial-Heap
Small project where I implement binomial heap data structure.

The program has following commands:


S (node) Prints the node.


P (node) Prints node and all of its brothers.


V (node,v) Changes the value of the node to v.


U (heap, heap) Join two binomial heaps.


R (node, v) Decreases the value of the node.


M (heap) Prints minimal value of the heap.


A (heap) Prints identification of the node with minimum value in the heap.


E (heap) Removes the node that contains the minimum value in the heap.


D (heap, node) Remove node from the heap.
